## P0 — RMCP 3.x foundation

- [x] Create the `hackmd-mcp` Cargo crate with `license = "MIT"` on a Rust
  version supported by `rmcp` 3.x. Pin `rmcp = { version = "3",
  default-features = false, features = ["macros", "server", "transport-io"]
  }`; use its transitive `schemars` rather than a second MCP framework or
  hand-written JSON-RPC dispatcher.
